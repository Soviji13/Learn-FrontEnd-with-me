# Learn Front-End With Me 🚀

Welcome to my personal front-end learning repository! 

👀 If you want to see the Live Preview of all, click [here](https://soviji13.github.io/Learn-FrontEnd-with-me/)!

👩‍💻 Here you'll find a series of **small practical projects** that I've developed while diving deep into the world of front-end development.  
Each project is **well-documented** in its own folder with notes and explanations 

🫡 This repo is meant to:
- Track my learning journey
- Practice good development habits
- Share and document everything that helped me understand front-end better

> 🇪🇸 Projects are commented in Spanish, but all documentation is in English for broader accessibility.

> ✏️ I'm continuously improving the look and structure of this portfolio.
