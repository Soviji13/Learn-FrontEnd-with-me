👩‍💻 Here you'll find a series of **small practical projects** that I've developed while diving deep into the world of front-end development.  
Each project is **well-documented** in its own folder with notes and explanations 

🫡 This repo is meant to:
- Track my learning journey
- Practice good development habits
- Share and document everything that helped me understand front-end better

> 🇪🇸 **Projects are commented in Spanish**, but **all documentation is in English** for broader accessibility.

> ✏️ I'm continuously improving the look and structure of this portfolio.

> 📅 **The listed projects are ordered by creation date**. If there is any concept that is not explained, check the previous project — you will surely find it there!
